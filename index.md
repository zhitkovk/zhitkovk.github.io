## About
I am a data analyst and the main focus of my job is to study __user behaviour__ using common sense, metrics and AB testing. This website offers you a small collection of hyperlinks leading to the examples of simulations and data visualizations I have created. Also you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kzhitkov).
